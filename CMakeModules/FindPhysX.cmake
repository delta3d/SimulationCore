# - Find the Boost includes and libraries.
# The following variables are set if Boost is found.  If Boost is not
# found, PHYSX_FOUND is set to false.
#  PHYSX_FOUND        - True when the Boost include directory is found.
#  PHYSX_INCLUDE_DIRS - the path to where the boost include files are.
#  PHYSX_LIBRARY_DIRS - The path to where the boost library files are.
#  PHYSX_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS - Only set if using Windows.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you have installed PhysX in a non-standard location or you have
# just staged the boost files using bjam then you have three
# options. In the following comments, it is assumed that <Your Path>
# points to the root directory of the include directory of PhysX. e.g
# If you have put PhysX in C:\development\PhysX then <Your Path> is
# "C:/development/PhysX" and in this directory there will be two

# 1) After CMake runs, set PHYSX_INCLUDE_DIR to <Your Path>/include/boost<-version>
# 2) Use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to set a path to <Your Path>/include. This will allow FIND_PATH()
#    to locate PHYSX_INCLUDE_DIR by utilizing the PATH_SUFFIXES option. e.g.
#    SET(CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH ${CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH} "<Your Path>/include")
# 3) Set an environment variable called ${PHYSX_ROOT} that points to the root of where you have
#    installed Boost, e.g. <Your Path>. It is assumed that there is at least a subdirectory called
#    include in this path.
#
# Note:
#  1) If you are just using the boost headers, then you do not need to use
#     PHYSX_LIBRARY_DIRS in your CMakeLists.txt file.
#  2) If Boost has not been installed, then when setting PHYSX_LIBRARY_DIRS
#     the script will look for /lib first and, if this fails, then for /stage/lib.
#
# Usage:
# In your CMakeLists.txt file do something like this:
# ...
# # Boost
# FIND_PACKAGE(PhysX)
# ...
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${PHYSX_INCLUDES})
# TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(libname ${PHYSX_LIBRARIES})
#
# In Windows, we make the assumption that, if the Boost files are installed, the default directory
# will be C:\boost.

#
# TODO:
#
# 1) Automatically find the Boost library files and eliminate the need
#    to use Link Directories.
